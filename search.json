This would be done by utlizing my skills in excel to determine such things like demographics, ages, and location. Doing this I can learn what the team needs to advertise and they can use to bring more fans to there games.\nUsing my skills in Rstudio and also Python I am able to produce websites and informative presentations to show my finding and make them readable. I am able to transfer excel sheets into Rstudio and by doing that I am able to wrangle important data and determine the answers that are needed."

You can also see in majority of the questions I have added different kinds of graphs and charts. You can see that I have made numbers or words on the y and x axis and I made it so they have multiple color indicators as well as otehr useful things.\nSkills Demonstrated:\n\nData Wrangling: Took data from datasets and layed out the data that was needed.\nVisualization: Turned that data into visual charts and graphs.\nCustomization: I made color indicators and added legends to the graphs and charts.\nUse of Ggplot2: Used the package ggplot to develop my graphs and charts.\n\nBelow is an embedded demonstration of the interactive report:"
